## About the Project

This project is a simple calculator app built as a demo to explore how Astro can render components from different frameworks on the same page using islands architecture. It includes:

- A **React** calculator component
- A **Svelte** calculator component

Both components function identically, but they showcase how Astro seamlessly integrates different frontend frameworks within a single project.

## Features

- üèùÔ∏è **Astro Islands**: Each framework's component is rendered as an island, keeping JavaScript execution minimal.
- ‚öõÔ∏è **React Component**: A version of the calculator built with React.
- üß° **Svelte Component**: A version of the calculator built with Svelte.
- üåê **Live Demo**: Hosted at [calculator.ehrmantraut.me](https://calculator.ehrmantraut.me).
